# Chebyschev

R program to run a Chebyschev analysis on fault data. 

Current stage:
-Chebyschev function is complete
-Threshold optimisation function is complete
-Window optimisation is incomplete. This may require significant processing time and should be run as an overnight script on Z400 using cronjob.
